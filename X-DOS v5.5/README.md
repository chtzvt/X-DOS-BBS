#X-DOS

This is X-DOS, which is a sort of interactive shell with games and utilities baked in. It was a collaborative effort between myself and my friend, [David Dodge](http://www.pottedtoast.com), and is actually the thing
that got us into programming. This is the 5th(ish) and final version, released in 2012. X-DOS' ancestry, however, stretches back to around 2009-10. Over the years, it was gradually improved and built up. 
Like most things produced by very young, fledgling programmers, it's a useless, ugly, buggy mess. 

Enjoy!
